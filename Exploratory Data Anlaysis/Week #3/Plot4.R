## Exploratory Data Analysis - Project #2 - Question #4

## Load Data - Ensure"summarySCC_PM25.rds" & "Source_Classification_Code.rds" are in your working directory
NEI = readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")
SCC <- readRDS("Source_Classification_Code.rds")

## Question #4 - Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999â€“2008?
