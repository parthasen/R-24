## Exploratory Data Analysis - Project #2 - Question #3

## Load Data - Ensure"summarySCC_PM25.rds" & "Source_Classification_Code.rds" are in your working directory
NEI = readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")
SCC <- readRDS("Source_Classification_Code.rds")

## Question #3 - Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999â€“2008 for Baltimore City?

library(ggplot2)
BaltimoreData = subset(NEI, fips == "24510")
qplot(year, Emissions, data=BaltimoreData, stat="summary", fun.y="sum", col=type, geom = "line", main = "Baltimore City Emissions by Type & Year")
dev.copy(png, file = "plot3.png")
dev.off()
