## Exploratory Data Analysis - Project #2 - Question #5

## Load Data - Ensure"summarySCC_PM25.rds" & "Source_Classification_Code.rds" are in your working directory
NEI = readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")
SCC <- readRDS("Source_Classification_Code.rds")

## Question #5 - How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999â€“2008 in Baltimore City?
